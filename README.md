Java MySQL Database Interaction Project

Description:
This project showcases how to establish a connection to a MySQL database using Java, perform checks on the database's structure, and modify the database by creating tables and inserting data. It provides a foundational understanding of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

Key Learnings:
Establishing a Connection: Learned how to connect to a MySQL database using JDBC.
SQL Statement Execution: Executed SQL commands in Java to create tables and insert data.
Database Integrity Checks: Implemented checks to determine if specific tables exist and conditionally modify the database.
Getting Started

Dependencies:
Java JDK 8 or higher.
MySQL Database Server.
JDBC Driver for MySQL.
Setting Up
Ensure MySQL is running on your local machine.
Create a new database or use an existing one.
Update the database URL in Main.java with your database details.
Running the Application
Execute Main.java to start the application. It will connect to the specified database, check for the tab1 table, create it if it doesn't exist, and populate it with sample data.
Usage

This application can be used as a template for any Java application that requires database interaction.
Modify the SQL statements in Database.java to interact with different tables or perform various operations.
